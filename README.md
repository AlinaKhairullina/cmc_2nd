# Studying at the Faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics (CMC)

**In the repository you can see my various files in some programming languages that were written in seminars at the university, some homework, and also files that were written for fun.**
---

**It contains the 'CC++', 'Pascal' directories.**

- The `C/C++` directory contains files created at seminars in 'Seminars', homework in `dz`, various files with other programs `features`, a ping-pong game between several processes, performed using various synchronization methods in `ping -pong`, as well as some programs written in C++ in the `C++` directory, which I am currently studying.

- In the Pascal language, only one program has been preserved for sorting an array using the Shell method and insertions in the `Pascal` directory.
